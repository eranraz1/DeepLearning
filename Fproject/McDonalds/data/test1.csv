"We loooooove junk food and we love McDonalds BUT, this specific location was a total frustration today. ξWe get there and there's about 4-5 people in the line before us and. by the time we order, maybe another 5-6 waiting BEHIND us. ξSo we place our order with Roberto, who is only in charge of the orders and the register, he will not do anything else. ξWe then proceed to wait for our food, we were hungry and in a rush so this was the easiest (and yes, unhealthy) option, or so we thought at the time. So we wait and wait and then wait some more and, in the meantime, the 5 people that came in AFTER us got their food and left...it's like HELLO!!!! WTF!!!! so hubby complains to Roberto who proceeds to explain that he only takes the order nothing else...duh! then Miguel, the manager, comes over, doesn't like the fact that hubby's obviously not happy with the situation and tells him it'll be another few minutes....w/e.Finally our food is ready and, guess what?!?!?!?!?! it was WRONG!!! WTF again!!! hubby goes back to the counter and now he is not nice at all and asks 'so how long will it take for me to get my correct order?' to which Miguel, the manager, turns around, gets hubby's correct order and exchanges it for the wrong one....HUH!?!?!?!?!?! amazing!!! By the time we get our food we are beyond hungry and in a not so nice mood. Oh well, at least I have to say that Miguel came to our table, when the rush was over to apologize for the incident and to offer us tomorrow's lunch for free, but we gratefully declined.","[0, 0, 0, '0.6817', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service.The Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it.They do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it.","['1.0', '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"The argument can be made that reviewing a McDonald's is a waste of everyone's time. ξThis McDonald's, however, warrants special mention. ξAlthough the place is reasonably clean and they generally get your order right, the length of time it takes for this to happen is genuinely baffling. ξNo matter what time of day you come in or how busy the place happens to be, it will always take far longer to complete your transaction than it reasonably should. ξIn light of the fact that speed is supposed to be the selling point of a McDonald's, I'd call this particular location a failure.","[0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"I'm not a huge fan of McDonalds in general, but I do eat at a McDonalds about once a month or so. ξThis McDonalds is one of the worst that I've been to. ξThe service inside was very slow. ξThe manager, who was helping run the cash register with another employee, kept allowing other people to jump in line and then looked at the rest of us with this look of...""You don't mind, do you?"" ξWe decided to go through drive through instead hoping for faster service. ξWe got to the speaker and the employee asks ""What do you want?"" ξNot a ""How can I help you"" or anything semi-customer service oriented. ξWe decided to order anyway because my daughter was really excited for some fries. ξOtherwise we would have left at this point. ξWe placed our order and then pulled up to pay. ξShe told us one amount and then ended up giving me change for another amount. ξHowever, I didn't happen to check it until I had pulled up to the next window. ξWe pulled up to get our order at the 2nd window and the employee asked us what we had ordered. ξNot just an item or two so she could make sure we were the next order, but she wanted to know everything we had ordered. ξI'm not sure why there was an issue in relaying the information from the 1st window to the 2nd (especially with computers). ξThe 2nd window employee was nice and even wished us a good day. ξThe order was right and the fries were hot. ξUpon looking at the receipt, the cashier did give me the correct change she just said the wrong amount. ξWhen it comes to ordering, it really bothers me when you walk into a restaurant that has their breakfast menu up even though they say they are not serving breakfast anymore. ξInside the breakfast menu was up, but they told others they were not serving it anymore. ξIn the drive thru, we asked (just in case because I really wanted a sausage biscuit) but they said again they weren't serving breakfast. ξThe biggest problem with this was that because the breakfast menus were up the lunch menus were not and you would have had to know exactly what you wanted to get. ξWe ended up getting the basics: fries, hamburger, drink. ξ(I don't have the number meals memorized, and I swear they are different at each McDonalds.)Overall the service was slow and the employees were rude. ξIt was not busy during our visit. ξIt was 11am right before the lunch rush. ξI would avoid this McDonalds if you can.","['1.0', 0, 0, '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"With the amount of time it takes to get your order here, it's hard to call this 'fast food."" Definitely, one of the worst run McDonald's I have ever seen. NO ONE wants to work. Between the lackadaisical cashiers to the employees just standing around instead of preparing food and filling drink orders, this place is a mess. Then add the dozens of homeless people in here and you really just want a shower when you get out. I say this, yet still go back at least twice a month (it's downstairs from my office and right off the 6 train, ok?) Another redeeming quality is the hash brown, which is perfectly cooked -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. ξWord of advice, listen very closely to the numbers when they call them out and steer clear of the bathrooms (don't even stand near them).","['0.6681', 0, '0.6568', '0.6681', 0, 0, 0, 0]"
I was craving fast food - hadn't had it in weeks - so I decided to try this McDonald's on my lunch break. ξThe food sucked. ξThe nuggets had no taste. ξGrease was dripping from my fries. ξThe ice machine was out of ice. ξA homeless man was walking around the store begging for money. ξI think I'm going back to my non-Mcdonald's/non-fast food ways.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, '1.0', '0.6562', 0, 0]"

"It's 2 for 1 review day! ξI can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside. ξAnd boy is it some tantalizing stuff.I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it. ξI hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one. ξNo Yelper should go unwarned. ξOf course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap. ξWhich when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'. ξAfter my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so. ξI need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately.My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE. ξI have a hard time resisting free. ξI'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!! ξSeriously.It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy. ξI patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time. ξAt least two folks left the line while I was there. ξI know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs. ξAnd they were very loud. ξThis doesn't bother me much. ξBut...they were also very stinky. ξYes, stinky. ξI have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess. ξTo each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN. ξIf I get a whiff and I have to take a step back? ξYou might be S-T-I-N-K-Y. ξBut who am I to judge? ξI took a big step back and waited my turn. ξFree is the motivation here. ξI finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy. ξHe takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it."" ξThen he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! ξMind boggling to say the least. ξHe takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up. ξ$2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.I wait. ξAnd wait. ξ#1! ξ#2! ξ#3! ξ#5! ξ#6! ξ#7! ξ#8! ξObviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting. ξHonestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there? ξMixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? ξFeathering a chicken? ξPerhaps ripening a tomato? ξI ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, ""We're waiting for your McWrap."" ξOf course.At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. ξThankfully I'm only three minutes away. ξI really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter. ξTalk about disappointment! ξI take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. ξI continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame. ξTheir golden fries. ξI bite into one, eh a bit stale. ξI bit into another one, eh not enough salt. ξI bite into yet another one, eh cold?? ξI look down, and whaddaya know? ξMy damn fry is not even barely cooked! ξWhite like Olivia Wilde in the winter. ξI look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! ξNot golden brown! ξNot delicious! ξBarely out of their frozen state, and just limp. ξNot acceptable! ξPlease check my pic for proof of this travesty. ξMcDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy. ξNO BUENO.After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap. ξWow, talk about lightning striking twice. ξThis thing was lifeless! ξAfter unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off. ξTortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. ξThe chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. ξAfter some hesitation, I took a bite. ξUGH I say, UGH! ξFreshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today. ξAll cold and soggy! ξAnd upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly! ξInstead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! ξAnd my bacon was missing! ξIn the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO! ξIt was McCrap through & through. ξTotally upset over this one. ξI have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. ξMcDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty. ξI will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. ξKnowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap. ξCRAP.","[0, 0, 0, '0.6725', '1.0', 0, 0, 0]"

I asked the manager to please replenish the napkins and lids and things like that and I please clear off an area for us and she ignored me. They messed up multiple peoples orders. Just dude was horrible. It is the first time I have ever had a Big Mac and not liked it. The French fries were stale. The hamburgers were thin and hard.

"I have been here many times because it is located conveniently on my way to campus. However, while I have experienced decent service inside the restaurant, going through the drive through has always been a disaster. Most of the time the voice box machines outside do not work. If they do, the employees cannot hear your order very well and the set up is not very well organized to support the long lines of cars that they receive.

Ok We have a consistent problem with this McDonald's. Specifically with the coffee. And that's too bad because McD's coffee is typically very good. Today's problem is the decaf. Old. Very old. I'd say from late last night possibly but certainly not brewed this morning. We should have went to the coffee shop next door. Previously (& not yet posted) Almost without exception either the coffee or the service is just awful here.

"I have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile. ξThe last two visits have been a disappointment. ξMy french fries were cold both times. ξI ordered a Premium Chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken. ξThe receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong. ξToday I ordered Chicken McNuggets as a combo. ξAgain and as I said before, cold fries. ξAnd I can guarantee the McNuggets weren't fresh. ξI got my food before I even got my change. ξIt had all been sitting there well before I ordered. ξBesides the food, service was terrible. ξThere was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food. ξIt made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour. ξRather than calling out an order or order number when ready, she looked at my boss and said ""this is yours."" ξHow rude! ξThere was a gentelman waiting for his food since before I walked in and was still waiting after I got mine. ξHis wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh. ξShe got a dirty look from the same rude cashier. ξI miss the days of the old manager whom I have not seen in a few months. ξHe had the staff on their game.","[0, '1.0', 0, '0.6829', '1.0', 0, 0, 0]"

This is hands down the WORST McD's location.I keep saying I wont go back but I think what keeps me going back is that living in the heart of Summerlin there isn't much of an option besides the Burger King on Town Center.The drive-thru is always so so so long and the workers at the window are so slow and seem like it is their first day every time. My order is NEVER right! I order a McGriddle and get a McMuffin WTH! The food is either overcooked or not accurate. What is with the coke? It always and I mean always tastes weird.I have sent an e-mail through the website complaining and they said since nobody else complained about the coke it must be fine. WRONG! If you get the nasty coke please send them an e-mail if enough people complain they might actually do something!!I usually go to the location on Charleston but since this one is so close I do still come here when I have coupons but I make sure and go inside where I can verify my order.,"[0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The trick is to find that perfect timing of when to check what's in the bag, how to roll up your window to avoid the homeless beggar and how much time to take to examine your bag's contents without annoying the people behind you who have also been waiting for 20 minutes + in the same drive-thru. ξThis place is horrible.The food taste like McDonald's food...but over-cooked or under-cooked. ξIt is never just right. ξDon't bother with the frozen yogurt either. ξThe machine must be faulty because it comes out like a sloppy mess. ξThe food here only taste good if you're drunk but you wouldn't be in the drive thru if you were drunk anyway! ;) I'd rather go to near-by Chano's Mexican Food.I have given this establishment multiple chances to prove me wrong but it has consistently under-delivered. ξIt is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. ξI challenge you to experience this review for yourself and you'll be surprised by its' truthful accuracy.Bottom line, I'd rather go hungry than go to this McDonald's.

"This particular location has by far the worst service overall. I am not lying when I say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drive-thru or walk-in, something is wrong with my order. I can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.The service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me? The guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drive-thru with only a partial order. This particular instance has happened several times.Unfortunately, I am a fan of their products, and when I get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle, this is the closest location.I have managed 3 food service installations, and I guarantee that I could run that place better than the current crew, given minimal training.I would say the 80's had lousy fashion, 90's had lousy music, and so far, aside from drivers of today, customer service is at its worst, especially for food service and more especially for McDonald's on Sunset and Stephanie.","['1.0', '1.0', 0, '0.6821', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I waited and waited for these kids (who weren't ordering) to move out of the way so I could get my hamburger happy meal with some ice cream. ξThe employee (their friend) was not even doing anything to get his friends out of the way so that he can assist the hungry people in line. ξI waited a total of 15 minutes to even order which has never happened before at a Mcdonald's. ξWhat made the experience even more aggravating was the fact that an older woman with a manager badge was not doing anything to diffuse the situation but instead laughed with the kids. ξThis isn't coming from a snooty tongue, especially because I'm pretty easily pleased when it comes to food and service but this was a bit over the top. We all know what Mcdonald's taste like so I don't have to go into detail about that...overall, I cured my craving but this experience was something to talk about in a bad way that I haven't done in awhile...Like i said, I'm easily pleased!

"This McDonald's is located right next to the building which houses Studio Movie Grill. ξIt's super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you don't want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater. ξBut that's pretty much where the pros of this location stop.I've been to this McDonald's several times, but I've been a bit disappointed on several occasions. ξMost recently, I went through the drive-thru and got a simple order - a McChicken sandwich and small fries. ξI drove to the Studio Movie Grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold. ξUGHHHHH... ξCold McDonald's fries are the worst. ξLame!!!The employees seem to be pretty friendly, and the restaurant looks decent inside. Unfortunately, they lack power outlets (I saw one, but maybe there's a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant). ξThis makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald's to use their laptops, which I do quite often.Overall, this McDonald's deserves about 2.5 stars because it's right in between ""meh"" and ""A-OK."" ξI know some may say it's ""just a McDonald's,"" but hey - I've been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent (don't serve COLD fries!) and there are numerous power outlets for customers' use. ξI'll probably be back just because it's right next to Studio Movie Grill, but I'm hoping they'll start improving the quality of their fast food - at least to the McDonald's standard.[Review 076 of 366]","[0, 0, 0, 0, '0.6407', 0, 0, 0]"

"(I wrote most of this on the toilet!)Did you like the movie ""Falling Down""? Then this is your McDonalds, friend! ξNow, a story about what a terrific husband I am:My wife was hungry one Saturday morning and wanted something quick. I said, "" How about McDonalds?"" We rarely visit the place and let's be honest, we all know what to expect. Yeah, it's terrible for you. It's a chain with no ""indie cred"", but it's hard to deny that a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is delicious even if it's not served by a cool guy with a handlebar mustache.So I rolled up to the San Fernando location, just blocks away from the infamous Drew Street and former Avenues Gang stronghold. The drive through line was looooong and I thought, ""I'll just go in!"" That'll be quick, right?The interior was that edge-of-anarchy you only get on a Saturday in a sketchy corner of a big city. Kids, post-soccer games all jacked up on Cokes and orange slices, a dense crowd that stands a liiiiitle to close, a few vagrants and an overwhelmed staff that handles it fairly well.I finally left about 15 minutes later (yes, really), after several false alarms of ""Oh! I think that's mine."" ξIronically, my ORANGE JUICE is what held up the order while I watched the biscuit, McMuffin and hashy-b's get cold. ξI walked out politely but my head was spinning with entitled yuppie frustration and thoughts of ""Well, I'm never going in there again."" One time, no joke, I got a cheeseburger with no burger! Kinda hilarious actually, and the manager came through for me with a TWO free cheeseburgers as an apology.

She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha.

"It never fails that if you go to this McDonalds late at night they seem to give you the bottom barrel fries that has been sitting there for an hour.

"On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight ξcursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. ξIf you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.","['1.0', 0, 0, 0, '1.0', 0, '0.6562', 0]"

"Many many late night munchies have been satisfied at this establishment. Other people complain about how they sometimes don't have everything in stock. I've only run into that situation 1 or 2 times since I'm not that picky when it comes to fast food. Beggers can't be choosers imo. I usually order a simple burger so they're bound to have that in stock. My friend always gets salads so sometimes they're out of the kind he usually gets. But again that has happened like 1 or 2 times at most.As for the food, even late at night the food is served hot so I'm definitely satisfied there. Inside is just like any other Mcdonalds with an indoor playpen for kiddies. Overall I haven't had any bad experiences with this place other than the occasional homeless person walking up to your car asking for money when you're sitting in the drive-thru at 2 am.

"On my way to Curry Honda for my scheduled maintenance appointment, I went to the drive-thru of this McDonald's since it was so conveniently located almost adjacent to the Honda dealership. ξIt was around 1:45 pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably only two cars in front of me, so I thought I'd be in and out of there quickly. ξWhat I thought would be a ""quick"" drive-thru took over ten minutes. ξI'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order. ξAll I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there. ξHowever, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted. ξI guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers. ξBoo. ξIt was my first time trying the Spicy McChicken Sandwich, and I thought it was decent. ξIt has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol' McChicken Sandwich.Overall, this McDonald's gets 3 stars for being ""OK."" ξYes, service could have been quicker, and the food should have been served hotter, but this is a McDonald's and at least the employees were friendly. ξI may return to this McDonald's if I'm on my way to Curry Honda and didn't have time to grab food elsewhere, but it wouldn't be my top choice for fast food in the area.[Review 324 of 366]","[0, 0, 0, '0.6909', '0.6545', 0, 0, 0]"
