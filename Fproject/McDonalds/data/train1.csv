I didn't like their drive thru service.,"['1', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Alma is the so called manager at this McD's by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced she was upset because they got my order wrong and I brought it to her attention. There after I can see and hear her complaining to the other employees in front of customers not sure what's up her butt seems to me mad at the world.....very unprofessional!!!!,"['1.0', '0.6786', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"So my first experience with this McDonald's was the day that I moved in. I had a couple friends helping me. This McDonald's is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought ""why not go to McD's"". Seems logical. I mean, McD's is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands. This is a 4, 5, 6, oh hell, I don't even know how many corners there are here, intersection. And one of the lights is only green for one side of the street, but has no sign indicating that anywhere, so people either don't stop or just stand there. You feel like you are playing Frogger. Except not with a pixellated frog, but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body, you will see they always have at least 15 people working here. Yet, there are never more than 2 registers open at once. And the only people working those registers are either a. ancient, non-english speaking women b. mentally handicapped. Hey, I appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate. I do not appreciate the game of charades I must play with the cashiers to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here, you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest. Ricky Martin pictures, signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here. Apparantly, this is the Latin Rock n' Roll McDonalds. Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald's I have ever seen that has Jalepeno's as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks. I would give it only 1 star, but hey, its open 24-7 and its McDonalds.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0]"
"the operations and food seem fine, but this location has a chronic problem with leaving things out of my order. sometimes a salad would be missing, another time a cheeseburger was missing. Many times sauces I ask for are missing. I never made a big deal because a few bucks wasn't worth driving back there and bothering the employees about it. 2 stars since this place doesn't actually cook the food (cook and defrost.. two different things) and it's more about service. You had ONE job, just get the order right... the food is already cooked and arrives frozen. You just microwave it, wrap it and toss it in a paper bag... but no, that was too challenging.the soft serve ice-cream is great, but i've seen locations that stack the ice cream wayyy higher...","[0, '1', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"OK. so. ξWhen we first moved here..... We had a bunch of friends visit and come stay at our brand new house back in 2008? ξI don't remember... a while back. ξBut this joint was still fairly new. ξWe came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat. ξ[Keep in mind that this is during the summertime]So we go in.. and there are flies. ξFLIES. ξall over the place. ξI'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong. ξI'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite. ξSo I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on? ξAnd the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the ""get out of here"" look. ξSo, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there. ξI'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in. ξIt was like walking through a wall.

I should say that I have been back. ξBUT. . . ξyears later and not after I put in a call to let the proper people know that there was a HUGE problem.... it's not always the cleanest either.

"This is the McDonald's that my friends and I always go to since it's the closest to our apartment but at the same time, it's definitely the WORST one I've ever been to.One plus is that their drive-thru is open 24 hours but sadly, the later at night you go, the more often your choices are limited. For example, one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they couldn't make it! Okay. What's the point of staying open 24 hours if you can't even give the customers the food they want?!The other day, I had a pretty bad dine-in experience. The lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the McDouble which I have NEVER experienced before. Usually going through drive-thru, they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO!!Then, this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer. So I patiently waited... and then she closed the cash register AGAIN after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change!!!! So I had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semi-apologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting! ARGH! Worst McDonalds worker ever!! Completely rude and horrible customer service skills! I totally agree with my boyfriend who said this McDonalds is very poorly managed. He even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded. ""We love to see you smile?"" I beg to differ.","['1.0', 0, 0, '0.731', 0, 0, '0.731', '1.0']"
"The good news -- they've just remodeled this place, and it it super modern/stylish, like going to Starbucks. Now for the bad news: ξhigh volume McDonalds have been trying different line workflows for the last six months, at least at this location and the one in Union Station, and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait 10 minutes for a cup of coffee. ξAs another review said, it's probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a line 2-3 deep, place your order, and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you, so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter & back delivering your bag of food. ξThis actually got you your food pretty quickly, even in peak times.So now the newest system is a single register to take orders, and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a TV screen. ξSounds great, right? ξNot at this location. ξFor some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow. ξIt took 10 minutes the other day for my order to come up, and with the old system, it would be 2-3 minutes consistently, I think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders, not a centralized mainly single-threaded process with the new system.This morning I walked in, saw the line in front of the register was 2 deep, and 20 people were waiting for their orders (20!). ξThis isn't DeKalb where a busload of people just walked in. ξIt's McDonalds, and they clearly need to to fix something with this store / their new process, or just change back to the old chaotic system that got you your food in 2-3 minutes consistently.","[0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"I must say that I had a smoothie here when they came out months ago and they are horrible and way too sweet. Sonic has better ones and McD's obviously doesn't use real fruit. Even at midnight, this is not the best sweet tooth option. Wait, there is a positive. Using my 2-1 coupon, I tried the new Strawberry Frozen Lemonade and yes like the commercials indicate it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small. The strawberry syrup at the bottom might be the same they use on sundaes, but who knows for sure. McDonald's comes out with new stuff every month, but in the beverage department, frozen lemonade is king.","[0, 0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0, 0]"
"My visit here was my cycling lunch stop, so I was probably more happy than the average patron to see these golden arches. ξThis McDs is renovated in the dark-wood-meets-quasi-Starbucks-style and while all appeared trendy and chic (one could even watch the game on the suspended flat-screen TV), closer inspection revealed a floor that needed to be swept and a few tables that required a good wipedown. ξWe had to wait longer than I wanted (10 minutes!) for my food, but then again, I was only half done my 50 mile ride at that point and wanted food NOW. ξAlso, exacerbating the wait, I know that drive-thru customers get priority, due to corporate demanding fast order-to-receipt times. ξHowever, my fries were salty and hot, my burger was fresh and tasted the same as other McDs burgers I've consumed, and child chatter was minimal. ξ;)","[0, 0, '1.0', '1.0', '0.7', 0, 0, 0]"

"WELCOME. ξIt became patently obvious within one minute of entering this particular McDonald's that they have a different way of approaching the customer. ξMaybe it comes from the owner, but WELCOME. ξNot ""May I take your order?"" or ""Hello"" or ""Go ahead with your order when you are ready,"" just WELCOME then nothing else.So after being welcomed aloud many times before actually getting my turn to indulge in a childhood treat, I finally made it to the front of the line. ξReally, it was raining out, I didn't have an umbrella and this was the closest place to where I was working today so...Cashier: WELCOME.Me : (silence)Cashier: WELCOME.Me : (places order)Cashier : (no movement whatsoever)Me : (silence)Finally, she slaps a key and it is in. ξShe was actually friendly, but this dynamic was so awkward that I felt like I had been away from McDonald's too long and somehow lost a part of the lingo between fast food cashier and customer.Service was fast. ξThere are good McDonald's and bad McDonald's and this one was just in the middle. ξThe burger was warm, not hot, but tasted fine. ξThe coke was not sharp and bubbly and the fries were a little overdone. ξIt's McDonald's so there are no expectations, but this one just hit the middle.","[0, 0, 0, '0.6817', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

That you can't even look at them, without someone feeling some type of way. I avoid Harlem at any costs that I can. But I had to go to Mcdonalds, being said that this was the closest. First off the female there was out of it, I don't think she knew where she was, and they got all my order wrong. They put some really really nasty sauce spicy buffalo on my Mcchicken.

"On my way to the local brewery not too far from here we decided to grab a bite to eat beforehand. ξWe pulled into the drive through because getting out just seemed like an unnecessary risk. ξAs we waited and finally got up to the menu, the order taker informed us that they were only accepting cash at the moment. ξMy driver decided to exit the line but I insisted on getting him a meal. ξI risked life and limb to get that man dinner. ξI agree with the other reviewers that this place is less that satisfactory. ξThe cashier was not even the slightest bit delightful in my ordering experience. ξThe restaurant did not look very clean. ξThe employees were arguing about something very loudly that made me a bit uncomfortable. ξAnyway, I got the food and got out of there ASAP! ξI will not be back unless it is the last place on earth to get food.","['1.0', 0, '0.7179', '0.641', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this location unless you want dead flies in ξyour burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.","[0, '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '0.7223']"
"Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order.

"Never thought I'd write a review about a McDonald's, but I feel compelled. ξThis one was just re-built, replacing a perfectly servicable old one. ξWhatever, it's their money.My problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one, if that's possible. ξYou see, if you're coming from the east, entrance into the lot, either via entrances on North Avenue or Lowell (one way north), is no problem. ξIf you're coming from the west on North Avenue (or from the south on Kostner), you literally cannot enter the parking lot. ξAt all. I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). ξNope. ξNo entrance any more on Kostner. ξAnd you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). ξThere's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. ξSo I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. ξJesus. ξThe entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. ξThere are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? ξThe rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. ξYou used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. ξNow you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north ξto Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. ξGot all that? ξApparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's. ξI felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. ξIf you live east of here, you can't get out. ξAnd ya can't really go north, either. ξIt's maddening. ξIf you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. ξFrom my house (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. ξI realize McDonald's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving, and that badly designed intersection, but if it's that dangerous (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE. ξIt's a square lot, yet needlessly complicated. ξGrrr.","[0, '0.6667', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Only the fact that its a McDonald's is what earns it a 2.5 star. ξThe staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant disregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment. My last visit was a combination of the two, when I placed my order an the drive thru intercom, the order was taken correctly, total given, thanked and asked to drive around to the window. By the time I got around to the window, the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were with.I'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it didn't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all. About six months ago, someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location, but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm, so I wasn't worried about getting robbed as much as I was about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up, he accepted my cash, asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries. ξI did, and I did.Sure I'll go back. ξI love McDonald's fries. 18 of 100","['0.6988', 0, 0, 0, 0, '0.6571', 0, 0]"

"This is my third review of McDonald's across three different cities. ξYelp, I hope you're paying attention, because if this veritable display of fast food prowess isn't enough to grant me Elite status, I just don't know what is.Because it's McDonald's, and everyone knows that McDonald's serves the most amazing flash-frozen food in the world, I employ a different rating system where every one I go to starts at 5 stars. ξI take off stars according to my experiences there.Let's begin for this location:5 stars: it's McDonald's, for chrissake. ξI don't need to justify this.4 stars: I had to knock it down one star because they ran out of cheeseburgers once at like 2:00am. ξWhen they first told me, it didn't even register in my brain. ξI ordered two cheeseburgers and the lady replied ""sorry, we don't have cheeseburgers right now."" ξAll I could say was ""no, just a regular one, not a McDouble."" ξShe had to repeat it again and I was so flabbergasted that I sat silently in the drive-thru window as my world was crashing around me. ξFour hours later I was able to collect my thoughts and order a Filet-O-Fish.3 stars: there is a constant ring of transients that surround this place late at night. ξThey come up to you when you're pulling up to the window. ξThey don't even ask for food, they try and give you money to buy stuff for them because, presumably you can't ride a shopping cart into the drive-thru. ξOne time I was feeling nice and bought a lady a coffee, but then she proceeded to yell at me as I was driving away because I only got her 10 sugar packets instead of the 50 million that she requested. ξOn the plus side, the establishment does a reasonably good job of keeping them out after hours, so now I know where to board myself up during a Zombie Apocalypse.2 stars: one time they questioned me when I ordered 80 nuggets. ξDID I STUTTER? ξIt's 3:00am on a Saturday night, you should be questioning the people who get a 6 piece. ξ100 is pretty standard these days. ξWith two of every sauce, including some that don't exist (""zesty...chipotle...thai peanut butter?"") ξI don't want to wake up on Sunday morning unless there's half-eaten nuggets under my pillow.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '1', 0]"

"TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others ""trapped"" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself ""trapped"" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). ξGod forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR!

HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital.

"I realize McDonald's is meant to be fast food, but to call this one particular location fast food is an oxymoron, unless waiting 30 minutes to get your items (and half the time they are incorrect), can pass as fast food now. ξI don't know why my friend keeps insisting on stopping here for a drink, it'd be faster to stop at Walgreens, get out of the car, get a bottle of coke, pay, and get back in the car to drive off. ξI believe the addition of a second drive-thru lane has created a bigger problem. ξThis is causing more congestion as the one right lane blocks people who have ordered in the left lane from being able to advance and join the main paying lane (which forces both lanes to immediately merge), especially if the ones in the right lane tailgate and won't let you in, even though you placed your order before them, which would imply your order would come up first. ξYou can easily sit in that left lane for 10 minutes while the people behind you are helpless and honk uselessly trying to move up to place their order. ξIn addition, the cashier has a hard time dispensing the correct items and keeping track of who ordered what. ξWe ordered a soda but were handed a bag with burgers and fries, which we promptly returned. ξThe associate then asked us if we were sure we hadn't ordered that...uh, what??

"This review screams ""First World Problems""...but until Yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the ""Third World"" (can one even still use that term without being offensive?), I guess all of the things about which we gripe will be ""First World Problems,"" won't they?Anyhow, my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drive-thru. We actually enjoy eating at McDonald's in general and think the food is good (some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology!), so it's not like this was a bad option. We actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the East Side and we generally received great service.Unfortunately, tonight was a night on which we received awful service.When we pulled up to the drive-through, the McDonald's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasn't available. I'm a teacher, and I'm used to deciphering...but this was incomprehensible. Of course, when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed off-limits, we were made to feel like buffoons.After we finally managed to figured out what was available, we ordered and pulled up to the window. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next--that's right, they got the order partially wrong. One of my wife's Chicken McNuggets even wound up outside of the container. Perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer, or perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully. I'll let you be the judge on that one. They also gave her the wrong sauce. I had no idea that ""Sweet and Sour"" actually means ""Barbeque.""Why we stopped at this McDonald's instead of driving to the McDonald's on Clark--which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes Ray Kroc smile in his grave--is beyond me.

"This isn't even a legitimate McDonald's... It's a gas station McDonald's!I've been to this location twice.

The smell of urine is simply unappealing. I also tried to redeem my LivingSocial coupon. They wouldn't accept it, because they couldn't find a button on the menu for it. Lame.

I've been to this drive through 3 times. I order simple things like a Big Mac meal or a couple burgers and fries. Yet some how they have never gotten my order correct. Today I ordered two hamburgers and fries. My hamburgers were damp and had pickled jalape��os instead of regular pickles. Not sure if this was a bad prank by the young staff or just a shitty burger that was made by someone who doesn't know the difference.Also their drive through is always packed and people line up into the adjacent albertsons parking lot and road.

I've seen some pretty bad places, but this place took the cake in terms of filth and vagrancy because the place seemed to be a location for people to loiter around in and having people up in there begging for change and all while you're trying to order your food. I was waiting with my fiance for his food to come up and the guy behind the counter was banging his hand saying ""can I help the next customer"".....really you think you can get someone's attention banging your hand on the counter like some ignorant fool with no professional standards. Who would want to eat in this place with folks standing outside trying to sell you stuff and this one guy was begging for change to allegedly feed his baby sister.....that's so typical for them to sit there and lie because they want someone to give them money so they can feed their whatever habit they're trying to hide. This restaurant is situated in one of the most ghetto neighborhoods on the west side which says how the standards has gone down. If they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and I was glad that I didn't see the inside of the bathroom because if it's a ghetto McDonalds the bathrooms wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either. I wouldnt bother eating here unless you want to be harassed by goofy hoodrats and crack fiends looking for someone to give them change. I can think of at least 10 McDonalds locations that has staff that don't look like they were plucked from the ghetto garden because this McDonalds seems to employ hoodrats and ghetto snots to work at this particular location.

The cashier advised me that I couldn't get a mocha, when I asked about a frappucino she said no to that too, and then mentioned that they were out of orange juice. Essentially I had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a Coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown. Now that I have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit I can say with all certainty that these two items should not be served together.This particular McDonald's does not exude any of McDonald's core philosophies such as variety or efficiency. It seems poorly stocked, poorly operated and under maintained. The bathrooms are filthy and I would suggest buying a cheap pair of socks for your child because their socks will be coated in dirt after 5 minutes of playing. The only thing that was good about my visit was my sausage egg biscuit sandwich. The hash brown tasted as though it had fried in old rancid oil.

"This review is based on the poor service I received in the drive thru last night. I have nothing to say about the food because it's McDonald's... I had a horrible headache and a long drive back from The Woodlands so I just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache. There were two cars in front of me when I pulled into the line. One car was at the pick up window, the other was at the intercom to order. It didn't take long for the car in front of me to order. When it was my turn, I literally sat there for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Usually if the employees are slow, they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers. I was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open. People were pulling up behind me and I was losing my patience. Finally some lady came on the intercom and said ""What can I get you?"" As if they were the ones waiting on me to decide. I could hear a lot of noise in the background (sounded chaotic). I asked for a grilled chicken wrap. She responded with ""We don't have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?"" Then I asked for Sprite. ""We're out of Sprite."" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. ""OK Sweet tea."" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn't even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea. Then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total. As I'm waiting to pay and get my food, I see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they're fed up with the poor service. When I got to the window, the lady even made a comment about it ""Ooooh look at all those cars leaving."" I'm sorry, but if you are aware that you are losing customers, maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you don't lose customers. She couldn't have cared less. It was pathetic.Luckily I don't live in that area, so I'm hoping to never have to experience such slow, horrible service in a drive thru.

"What is a Shamrock Shake? It's a seasonal shake (milk?) by McDonald's with green food coloring thrown in designed to exploit another made up holiday, St. Patty's day.

"The WORST service I've encountered in a McDonalds so far in the continental USA. No, not because I dislike the food but because the employees here are IRRESPONSIBLE, FORGETFUL, and UNAPOLOGETIC.

They will charge you for the wrong item, leave out several items, give Iced Tea instead of Iced coffee. When I was there, I was the first one to order and I ordered the Skillet Burrito and some OJ. My OJ came out after 3 minutes but my food never came out. ALL OF MY co-workers ordered their food and their food came out and they were already seated and having their breakfast while I'm still standing at the counter waiting for my burrito for a good 10 minutes. I finally lost my patience and ask the girl who rang me up where my Skillet Burrito was. She simply says ""Oh, it's run out, ""we NO HA-VEH"". I tell her ""So are you going to just stand there and do NOTHING?!?!?!?!?"" That's when she asks me ""What do you want???"" You want burrito!?? We only HA-VEH Sausage and Egg Burrito it's ok?

"Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald's and McDonald's food isn't really an essential service; people generally know what they're getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald's had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn't just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood."" Really? Since when does being authentically ""black"" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it's mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. And youth thugs (of any race) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the ""Wild mid-West."" Just a thought, Rahm - do what you want with it.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '0.6407', 0, 0]"

"I apologize ahead of time to the owners for giving bad publicity to this McDonald's but over the few times I have visited this location, I have not had one good experience. 3 points for the Double K to consider:1. If a customer asks for a refund after waiting over 25 minutes for a 4 piece nugget meal for their kid, your managers should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people; maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested; maybe even go so far as to motivate the employees to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones.2. If your staff cannot handle the business from the counter AND the drive through at the same time, maybe NOT such a good idea to ADD another drive through lane; another way to slam the staff with orders they cannot fill within a reasonable time!3. In the process of remodeling any of your locations and there is no regular restaurant seating, a suggestion to accommodate your customers during this temporary situation would be to keep the Play Place seating open until close so customers have a place to eat in.There are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestions from 3 separate visits in hopes the reason for this kind of service is due to you guys not knowing what goes on in this restaurant.","['1.0', 0, 0, '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"If I were to die and go to hell, this McDonald's would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imagined.Let's begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold Chicago evening. All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won't get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald's Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka ""The Value Meal"". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service. No complaints here, it's not exactly the most cheery place to work. Servers were speedy, helpful and responsive.","[0, 0, 0, 0, '1', 0, 0, 0]"

"Normally I wouldn't review a fast food joint, but our (meaning my husband's and my) collective negative experiences have prompted me to review it.Every time we go there (usually through the drive-thru), they always forget something or get something wrong!! We even repeat our order in a slow fashion and enunciate every word and check the receipt. Even then, something is missing. Whether it's french fries, ketchup, dipping sauce, straws or even an extra patty (we like to order the double Filet-O'-Fish).You might be thinking, ""Well, it's McDonald's what do you expect?"" And you're right. We should know better, and we should always check the bag before leaving. But I digress. My one and only example of the Idiocracy-type service I've experienced I will give is this: I went through the drive-thru and ordered two meals with large drinks each. When I got to the food window, I was given one large drink and one medium. When I complained and said it wasn't what I ordered, the guy at the window looked bewildered. He said he couldn't fix it because the automatic drink machine wouldn't allow him to manually pour another one. Then when I asked, ""Well, can't you just go get me another one?"" he said, ""I can't leave my spot."" Then I countered with, ""Well, can you get someone ELSE to do it?"" he said, ""Uh, I can't leave my spot. I can give you a cup and you can come inside to get it yourself."" What?? I went through the drive-thru because I had just come from the vet and I had the dog in the car. I told the employee, ""I went through the drive-thru because I have my dog with me!"" He didn't say anything. I mean, he obviously wasn't the best with troubleshooting OR customer service, so, I went to park, got the drink and left. Every time after that, something in our order was messed up. The food was fine, but something was always either wrong or missing. We know better than to eat their food (for obvious reasons) but since their service is consistently terrible we won't be going back.","['0.6579', '0.6842', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"I usually don't have problems with this location even though I get irritated with their employees' attitudes sometimes. Today, however, my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there. The one worker that I absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side. She has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job. She is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right. When I drove up to the pick up window, a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food. I ordered two combos. I waited about 15 seconds for my drinks, and he was awkwardly standing there, wondering why I didn't drive off yet. Then he asked, ""Are you waiting for something else? That should be it."" I said, ""...We ordered drinks too."" He looks behind him and there are my drinks! ""Oh!"" he exclaims. As I am situating the drinks into my cup holders, I hear him say, ""Here."" When I turn around towards the window, half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face! WTF?! I was so irritated by his incompetency. Also, one thing that I don't like is how two drive-thru speakers are built, but the employees are always confused by which one to use. For example, I would order at the first speaker. When there is a long line, I get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when I already ordered at the first one! Sometimes I tell them that I've already ordered, and sometimes I ignore them even when they're constantly asking, ""Hello? Are you ready to order?""Incompetent workers and a confusing drive-thru!

"One star because McDonald's is not food... it's engineered matter that just happens to be edible. But I thought I'd review this McDonald's in particular. It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out.

"Normally I don't bother reviewing places like this, but this McDonalds is so hilariously awful that I felt it was my duty to share this information with fellow Yelpers.The irony of this specific McDonalds is that it is an exceptionally nice one both inside and out. It is ultra-modern with a great little outdoor garden with seats! I've never seen a McDonalds like this before.Unfortunately it is absolute chaos inside. As some other reviewers have said, the staff have no control over it and it turns into a free-for-all. I honestly think Chicago PD needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 24/7, since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on. I'm surprised no one has been stabbed and/or shot.Even if you are just passing by, you will immediately know something is up with this place. There are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day, making weird comments at strangers. Again, it's nothing short of a miracle that people haven't been stabbed or shot here. I make it a point to walk past as quickly as possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird looks and act like they want to fight.Seriously, if this place got bulldozed tomorrow morning I don't think anyone would shed a tear and the adjacent buildings' property values would quadruple.

"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -Sarah (This was written by Paul's wife because I am usually the one dealing with them.

Not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chef.Even with appropriate low expectations, this location takes the cake for subpar service. ξAbout a week ago I was exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurants near where I live.

"This location is hit or miss, its usually ok. But 2 occasions made me not want to come back.

No big deal, I walked back up, explained what happened, and asked if I could have another without sauce. I didnt ask to replace mine, as I decided to give that one to a friend, and I just ordered a new one. A couple minutes later, I got it without sauce, but they also left out the bacon! So I had to go back to the counter, they gave me some bacon to put in but how hard is it to make these things? My second experience that i'd rather forget was when I ordered a grilled chicken chipotle snack wrap. Snack wraps are small as it is, but this one seemed to be folded in half of what is the normal size. I went and asked why it was so small and the guy got a manager who told me the chicken is weighed and it was fine. I have never had a snack wrap like that before or since. I wouldnt care if they had replaced it or gave me more chicken, but the fact that they stood behind it is why i'll never go back there unless I absolutely have to.

"A McDonalds's with the worst continuing costumer service I have ever experienced on multiple occasions over the course of three years. Let's just say an average wait for a small fry is 25 minutes.Last night at 3:30 AM I pulled up to the drive-thru, just as a car was reversing out. I should have known then that I was warned. I continued to pull through, but after ten minutes or so no one asked me for my order. So I continued on through the drive thru, thinking I could order at the next window. Well actually I sat trapped in the drive thru for over thirty minutes with the line not moving, and my car not able to escape the raised drive thru. At one point an older male employee came to the first window, stood there, looked at me and laughed. Then he turned around and left (I assume to continue not doing work.)After a waste of 30 minutes, the car behind me left and I was able to reverse my way out. So I have a few recommendations: 1. Since your McDonalds sucks so much please do not barricade drive thru attendees without an escape route. 2. Learn how to make 'fast' food and 3. Fire your entirely incompetent staff.

Total should be $5.49 plus tax.I say PLAINLY at least a dozen times a month: ""Number 2 LARGE with COKE!"".My receipt SAYS PLAINLY: 1 QRT CHEESE ML-LRG $3.80 1 XLG COKE 1.89.

When a new line opened up, the server deliberately ignored me and called out in Spanish to a man who had been waiting in another line less than one minute, avoiding eye contact with me the whole time. I got on line behind him. She chit-chatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it. Another 5 minutes. By the time I got to the front of the line, no ""welcome"", not even a smile for me. I ordered my breakfast. She took my money and then proceeded to take the next two orders--this time, of course, having the staff (which themselves were working at a snail's pace) get my food. She handed me the bag with no receipt and no ""thank you"". I thought to complain to the manager, and then I looked at the nameplate of the person serving me. She WAS the manager. I hardly ever have had a bad experience at McDonalds, but I guess there's a first for everything. From now on, I'm getting my Big Mac fix at Penn Station or any of the other locations OTHER than this disaster at 28th and 6th. Just not this one, at least until I take some Spanish lessons, which seems to be the prerequisite to be treated like a human being.","['1.0', 0, 0, '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Logan Square doesn't have a lot to offer in the fast food lane, but when push comes to shove at least McDonald's is a decent go-to, right? This McDonald's lives in this world of hipster laissez-fair attitude, so when something is wrong, the answer here is ""too bad."" I went to this McDonald's the other night with my mom and ordered about $16 worth of food including two McFlurrys or soft serve with toppings dumped on top, stale chicken nuggets and 2 Diet Cokes. Only halfway through our meal did my mom notice her drink tasted funny... She looked at her receipt and saw the cashier made one drink a Coke Zero. I went to the counter for her and told Samantha, the manager, that the drink was wrong and I'd like a Diet Coke. She said the drink was half empty and I'd have to buy a new one. The shock on my face washed over her like she was a piece of smooth sea glass. My mom also tried to reason with her - ""Shouldn't the customer get what they actually ordered?!"" No. No you can not. Samantha then took my mom's receipt and threw it away. My mom asked for it back so she can officially complain. I give them credit for following up, but they're a lost cause. It wasn't the $1.05 it would've cost for a new drink, it's that Samantha and her crew are the most unfriendly group people I've ever experienced and to eat their food again would be to poison myself with their abrasive unhelpful attitude.","['1.0', '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Three cardinal sins:1) The ice cream cones cost twice as much here as other locations around Chicago. Granted, this means I'm paying $1.08 instead of $0.54.

Name another thing sold anywhere at a franchise where the price can vary so wildly. ALSO, I hate McDonald's, and the only reason I go there is because they're losing money by serving me under-priced ice cream cones - they can't possibly profit from this. Moreover, c'mon, an ice cream cone for fifty cents on hot Chicago day? Who could pass that up? Not even me, a McDonald's-hating hippie.2) Complete chaos at the ordering station, even with very little line.3) Pigeons being fed in the outdoor seating area - by an employee - who alternated from cursing at the pigeons to (when they got too close to her) throwing fries to get them to get away.

"It feels silly to write a review for a fast food establishment but I'm writing this only to jog my memory of what happened earlier this week. I walked in with the intention of grabbing a quick post-beer snack with a buddy. We sat down with something like 20 chicken nuggets (gross I know) and started eating away. Some few minutes later, we hear a commotion towards the entrance. I turn around and see what appears to be the dirtiest looking homeless man with long grey hair and beard and dirt stained jacket with holes in his shoes. The manager happened to notice him immediately and tried to escort him out. One thing led to another and this guy started going off on one of the most hate-fueled rants I've ever heard. Surprisingly, he was quite eloquent and made references to movies, pop culture, and some literary classics. Objectively speaking, I imagined this 6'4ish looking man was at one point quite educated and maybe even handsome. I was too busy observing the scene to actually record anything for Youtube. At first, he directed his hatred towards the manager and then went into a long address to everyone in the store. Long story short: there is a revolution coming and we are ill-prepared. We are leading our lives in ignorance and before we know it, the tides will shift. Men ""like him"" are congregating and amassing technology and weapons beyond our knowledge. Lol ok. At this point, he gestured pulling out a weapon and shooting everyone. At this point, the manager forcibly escorted him out against his restraint. A few moments later, he ran back in and pulled out an imaginary grenade, tossed it in the store, and ran back outside. I was just trying to enjoy my chicken nuggets.

"I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is. ξ Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries. ξI have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies. ξI have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes ξjust to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.""The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month.

"This McDonalds needs help...I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the ""go to"" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. I will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do.","['1', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"So McDonald's is currently promoting a $14.99 for 2 big mac meals plus a 20 piece nuggets. Sounds like a great deal, so I stepped in to purchase said meal for my family of young and old.This place is always crowded (of all people other than customers) who use this place as a porta potty. Not a problem, since I would never sit down and eat here anyway. However, the customer service is pretty darn poor, and my 1 star is based solely on that (I have no expectations for McDonald's foods).They do not have enough staff. There was exactly one person working in the 'kitchen' (making burgers), one person working soda/fries/ice creams (who I assumed to be the manager) and one person working the cashier. Now I understand that they're working minimum wage, but that does not excuse them to work so poorly. I had to repeat my order four times, and it took 30 minutes to be completed. Why? Because the cashier was VERY distracted from conversing with friends and coworkers. I would give zero stars, but 1 star is for the manager, who seemed to be the only one who was trying to fulfill the customers orders.I haven't been to a McDonalds in years, and this experience will serve as a reminder to me of why I should continue not to do so.","['0.6494', 0, 0, '0.6853', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"I went to this location a couple of weeks ago. This is how my visit went:I pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 10:30am just in time for breakfast. I was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menuI waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingFinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of McdonaldsI figured this was because the order speaker was broken or somethingBut no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimeI was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Keep in mind, my car is right there, I'm obviously waiting to order.Then the employee turned around and walked back into McDonaldsThen someone started taking my order over the speakerI ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. I was thinking in my mind ""do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you""Anyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my orderI was told the breakfast hours were overThen ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.Truth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn't have been. So then, i went back a few days later (because I'm the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn't in my bag when they gave me my order.Yea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don't get.

"I walked in as the only customer and ordered a happy meal for my daughter. There were four employees working and it took 15 minutes to get food. Waiting for fresh food is not the issue I have. The EXTREMELY POOR customer service and customer awareness is the major issue in this store along with the cleanliness of the dining area and bathrooms. One employee was texting at a table (not on break) when there were at least ten tables dirty. I actually wiped our table clean. The supervisor did nothing to direct the other employees to take charge of the mess or slow orders. A few more customers trickled in and also waited an excessive amount of time for food. There was a younger white male and a younger black male working when given the right guidance could probably be fantastic employees but under the direction they are receiving now, they will never move forward within your company and are hopefully looking for other jobs because your establishment should be shut down.

"The Sherwood McDonalds, for as long as I've lived in the area, is probably one of the worst fast-food places I've been to. Unfortunately, in the interest of convenience and time constraints, we end up running through the drive-thru on rare occasion.Earlier this week they once again met my expectations for being incompetent, apathetic and a waste of money.I ordered a couple meals. 2- 10pc Chicken nugget meals w/ hot mustard and a plain cheeseburger.How many dipping sauces are you supposed to get with the nuggets? 2 per.We got 3 total. 2+2=3 using their new math I guess.1 - plain cheeseburger. I guess at the Sherwood McDonalds that means you REALLY want a plain chicken sandwich because a chicken sandwich is what we received.Fries - COLD, CHEWY, NO SALT and the one medium fry was filled half way - I have a picture I'm attaching.They've installed visual ordering screens in the drive-thru but they've managed to completely defeat that failsafe of the customer confirming what they ordered when the staff can't manage to pay enough attention to what they are putting in the bags.Do yourself a favor.

I think that was too much to handle. The McFlurry came out quickly. The burger? Not so much.Their weird coffee machine was busted (I don't understand why people want to eat those sugar drinks), and it was making this huge line. They also had about 40 people behind the counter and 20 of them trying to fix the machine. I lie, but you get the idea. So, I waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger, like 15 minutes. I hate to say stuff, and I could tell they were backed up so I kept thinking it was just getting there (other people were waiting a while, too). I finally did say something, and OH WADDYA KNOW.

I told him what happened and that I'd like the specialty coffee I originally ordered. He pointed that it had been a week since the original purchase and that he needed proof I wasn't lying about my incorrect order. Mind you, at 6:30am 6 people were all waiting around for their order, which shows slow and poor service. I didn't argue and I walked away leaving my receipt on the counter. I was simply asking for a coffee, not even an entire meal. I don't post about these sort of things, but this time was different.

"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! ξBecause of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. There are not enough words in all of the languages I speak to describe the disgust that I experienced today at this McDonald's.

It got up to 216 when the cashier had to ask me what my order was. So slow and disorganized and barely any space to eat and sit down.","['1.0', 0, 0, '1.0', 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"They take coupons, the food came quickly after placing order on a Lunch time.The tables need to be a bit more clean. The outside they should really get someone to get those panhandlers away. It's annoying that you go in or out and they are asking for change. Sometimes they smell.Back to the food. There food might come out quick, but it isn't exactly at the ""best"" temperature. I go here because it's on the way.","[0, 0, '1.0', 0, 0, '0.688', 0, 0]"
Oct 7 14 12:13After giving me a wrap rather then a chicken sandwich the young black guy with a shaved head(real short hair) wouldn't let me order a mcflurry from the window and I had to get out to do 'dat'. Coworker 'you made him come in to order ?!' Guy ' yeah this ain't Burger King'. **NEWSFLASH** buddy just bc you hate your job doesn't mean you gotta hate me on me. Leave your SH!T attitude where it belongs. The drive through is so my lazy a$$ doesn't have to walk inside.,"['1.0', '0.6655', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
