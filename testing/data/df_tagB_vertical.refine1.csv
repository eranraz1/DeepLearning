6905,361,"['BadFood', 'SlowService']","it is 2 for 1 review day! ξi can not review the walmart without reviewing the mcdonald is that resides inside. ξand boy is it some tantalizing stuff.i try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this mcdonald is so deserves it. ξi hardly frequent a mcdonald is at all (although this is my second mcdonald is review in less than a week) but i need to let the peeps in on this one. ξno yelper should go unwarned. ξof course i came to mcdonald is since i have those coupons for their new contraption, the mcwrap. ξwhich when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sounds much like 'mccrap'. ξafter my second go round with this thing, i have made up my mind it is decidedly so. ξi need to write mcdonald is execs to change the name on this thing immediately.my coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a mcwrap of your choice for free. ξi have a hard time resisting free. ξi am here to tell you...worst almost free meal of my life!!! ξseriously.it was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy. ξi patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in mcdonald is time. ξat least two folks left the line while i was there. ξi know it is not mcdonald is fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs. ξand they were very loud. ξthis does not bother me much. ξbut...they were also very stinky. ξyes, stinky. ξi have no problem with stinky in most cases (i occasionally help the homeless so i know) but the guy in front of me had not washed in days if i were to guess. ξto each his own, and i know it is almost summer so i know we all want to save water...but damn. ξif i get a whiff and i have to take a step back? ξyou might be s-t-i-n-k-y. ξbut who am i to judge? ξi took a big step back and waited my turn. ξfree is the motivation here. ξi finally get up there to the mcdonald is cashier and present my coupon to the guy. ξhe takes a look at it and says 'we do not usually take the promo coupons at this location but we will let you use it."" ξthen he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! ξmind boggling to say the least. ξhe takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of mcwrap i want (grilled chicken & bacon) and rings me up. ξ$2.91 later i am given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.i wait. ξand wait. ξ#1! ξ#2! ξ#3! ξ#5! ξ#6! ξ#7! ξ#8! ξobviously i am #4 and 10 minutes later i am still waiting. ξhonestly, what the hell are you guys doing back there? ξmixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? ξfeathering a chicken? ξperhaps ripening a tomato? ξi ask the mcdonald is runner and he tells me, ""we are waiting for your mcwrap."" ξof course.at this point i am almost running late to be back at work, so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. ξthankfully i am only three minutes away. ξi really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reese is chocolate peanut butter eggs from last easter. ξtalk about disappointment! ξi take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. ξi continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonald is claim to fame. ξtheir golden fries. ξi bite into one, eh a bit stale. ξi bit into another one, eh not enough salt. ξi bite into yet another one, eh cold?? ξi look down, and whaddaya know? ξmy damn fry is not even barely cooked! ξwhite like olivia wilde in the winter. ξi look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! ξnot golden brown! ξnot delicious! ξbarely out of their frozen state, and just limp. ξnot acceptable! ξplease check my pic for proof of this travesty. ξmcdonald is not doing their fries right is like ikea not serving their swedish meatballs with gravy. ξno bueno.after getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken & bacon mcwrap. ξwow, talk about lightning striking twice. ξthis thing was lifeless! ξafter unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this mcwrap), i could just tell something was off. ξtortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. ξthe chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. ξafter some hesitation, i took a bite. ξugh i say, ugh! ξfreshness was not part of the gameplan for this mcdonald is today. ξall cold and soggy! ξand upon all, my mcwrap was not built correctly! ξinstead of having spring mix like it is supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! ξand my bacon was missing! ξin the words of our lord darth vader....noooooooo! ξit was mccrap through & through. ξtotally upset over this one. ξi have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. ξmcdonald is you have pissed off the wrong fatty. ξi will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. ξknowing my luck i will get a coupon for a free mcwrap. ξcrap.",Service,1.0

""we are out of sprite."" ok please give me unsweet ice tea.

[since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] while it is mildly funny that katelyn, emily, ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the american girl doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. and youth thugs (of any race) should not be permitted to turn this area into the ""wild mid-west."" just a thought, rahm - do what you want with it.",ScaryMcDs,1.0
